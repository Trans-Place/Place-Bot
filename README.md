# r/transplace Bot
Fork of PlaceDE Bot who forked it from PlaceNL Bot! Thanks guys!  
This is a Trans bot! The bot updates the things to draw from [here](https://github.com/Trans-Place/Image-Creator), to make sure there are no clashes.

## Install Instructions

Before running it make sure that your pixel-placing-ability is off cooldown.

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
2. Click this link: [https://github.com/Trans-Place/Place-Bot/raw/main/placedebot.user.js](https://github.com/Trans-Place/Place-Bot/raw/main/placedebot.user.js). Tampermonkey should come up asking if it should install the script. Click **Install**.
3. Reload the **r/place** Tab. A message on the top right should appear: "Requesting access token...". The bot is now active and will update you with information on the top right.
